	abstract = {For almost half a century, Paul Meehl educated psychologists about how the mindless use of null-hypothesis significance tests made research on theories in the social sciences basically uninterpretable. In response to the replication crisis, reforms in psychology have focused on formalizing procedures for testing hypotheses. These reforms were necessary and influential. However, as an unexpected consequence, psychological scientists have begun to realize that they may not be ready to test hypotheses. Forcing researchers to prematurely test hypotheses before they have established a sound ?derivation chain? between test and theory is counterproductive. Instead, various nonconfirmatory research activities should be used to obtain the inputs necessary to make hypothesis tests informative. Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and the functional form of those relationships, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions. Providing these inputs should be recognized and incentivized as a crucial goal in itself. In this article, we discuss how shifting the focus to nonconfirmatory research can tie together many loose ends of psychology?s reform movement and help us to develop strong, testable theories, as Paul Meehl urged.},

	abstract = {Effort and the feeling of effort play important roles in many theoretical discussions, from perception to self-control and free will, from the nature of ownership to the nature of desert and achievement. A crucial, overlooked distinction within the philosophical and scientific literatures is the distinction between theories that seek to explain effort and theories that seek to explain the feeling of effort. Lacking a clear distinction between these two phenomena makes the literature hard to navigate. To advance in the unification and development of this area, this article provides an overview of the main theories of the nature of effort and the nature of the feeling of effort, and then discusses how efforts and their feelings are related. Two key takeaways emerge. First, there is widespread agreement that efforts are goal-directed actions. Second, one of the main philosophical issues to be decided is whether feelings of effort should be defined by reference to efforts (effort-first approach), or whether efforts are defined by reference to the feeling of effort (feeling-first approach).},

	abstract = {Cognitive effort is thought to be familiar in everyday life, ubiquitous across multiple variations of task and circumstance, and integral to cost/benefit computations that are themselves central to the proper functioning of cognitive control. In particular, cognitive effort is thought to be closely related to the assessment of cognitive control's costs. I argue here that the construct of cognitive effort, as it is deployed in cognitive psychology and neuroscience, is problematically unclear. The result is that talk of cognitive effort may paper over significant disagreement regarding the nature of cognitive effort, and its key functions for cognitive control. I highlight key points of disagreement, and several open questions regarding what causes cognitive effort, what cognitive effort represents, cognitive effort's relationship to action, and cognitive effort's relationship to consciousness. I also suggest that pluralism about cognitive effort—that cognitive effort may manifest as a range of intentional or non-intentional actions the function of which is to promote greater success at paradigmatic cognitive control tasks—may be a fruitful and irenic way to conceive of cognitive effort. Finally, I suggest that recent trends in work on cognitive control suggests that we might fruitfully conceive of cognitive effort as one key node in a complex network of mental value, and that studying this complex network may illuminate the nature of cognitive control, and the role of consciousness in cognitive control's proper functioning.

	abstract = {Although widely used across psychology, economics, and philosophy, the concept of effort is rarely ever defined. This article argues that the time is ripe to look for an explicit general definition of effort, makes some proposals about how to arrive at this definition, and suggests that a force-based approach is the most promising. Section 1 presents an interdisciplinary overview of some chief research axes on effort, and argues that few, if any, general definitions have been proposed so far. Section 2 argues that such a definition is now needed and proposes a basic methodology to arrive at it, whose first step is to make explicit the various tacit assumptions about effort made across sciences and ordinary thinking. Section 3 unearths 4 different conceptions of effort from research on effort so far: primitive-feelings accounts, comparator-based accounts, resource-based accounts and force-based accounts. It is then argued that the first 2 kinds of accounts, although interesting in their own right, are not strictly speaking about effort. Section 4 considers the 2 most promising general approaches to efforts: resource-based and force-based accounts. It argues that these accounts are not only compatible but actually extensionally equivalent. This notwithstanding, it explains why force-based accounts should be regarded are more fundamental than resource-based accounts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/kbyhm},
	abstract = {Despite its apparent intuitiveness and widespread interest across various fields, ‘effort’ is a concept that seems difficult to define. The purpose of this article is to consider and define ‘effort’ during attempted task performance. In doing so I argue for distinction between the actual effort (objective effort) required, and the perception of that effort (subjective effort), during intentionally attempted task performance. I adopt a set theoretical approach to defining the intensional concepts, and extensional phenomenal constructs, and employ the tradition of Theory-Theory to illustrate tentative causal theories for and relating the concepts. The definitions I propose are deliberately agnostic of the specific task demands being attempted (e.g. physical, cognitive, self-control, or a combination) and thus reflect ‘general’ definitions of effort and its perception. Throughout, I draw upon and synthesise literature from across a multitude of disciplines, combining empirical evidence with armchair philosophising, and offer what insights I have from my own experience both as someone experiencing ‘effort’, and as a third-person observer investigating it. This work is intended to, at the very least, make my own current pretheoretical conceptualisation and understanding of ‘effort’ transparent to other researchers, and aid interpretation of subsequent empirical work, theory building, and theory testing on the topic. Further, I hope it might be useful to researchers across various fields, unify paradigms and help with integration of learnings across disciplines, and further understanding of the role of ‘effort’ and its perception from a broad scientific perspective.},

	abstract = {The accurate measurement of the cognitive load a learner encounters in a given task is critical to the understanding and application of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). However, as a covert psychological construct, cognitive load represents a challenging measurement issue. To date, this challenge has been met mostly by subjective self-reports of cognitive load experienced in a learning situation. In this paper, we find that a valid and reliable index of cognitive load can be obtained through item response modeling of student performance. Specifically, estimates derived from item response modeling of relative difficulty (i.e., the difference between item difficulty and person ability locations) can function as a linear measure that combines the key components of cognitive load (i.e., mental load, mental effort, and performance). This index of cognitive load (relative difficulty) was tested for criterion (concurrent) validity in Year 2 learners (N = 91) performance on standardized educational numeracy and literacy assessments. Learners’ working memory (WM) capacity significantly predicted our proposed cognitive load (relative difficulty) index across both numeracy and literacy domains. That is, higher levels of WM were related to lower levels of cognitive load (relative difficulty), in line with fundamental predictions of CLT. These results illustrate the validity, utility and potential of this objective item response modeling approach to capturing individual differences in cognitive load across discrete learning tasks.},

Based on this framework, three broad categories of models are described: Item covariate models, person covariate models, and person-by-item covariate models, and within each category three types of more specific models are discussed. The models in question are explained and the associated lmer code is given. Examples of models are the linear logistic test model with an error term, differential item functioning models, and local item dependency models. Because the lme4 package is for univariate generalized linear mixed models, neither the two-parameter, and three-parameter models, nor the item response models for polytomous response data, can be estimated with the lmer function.},

These assumptions are often violated, particularly in educational testing situations, in which students are grouped into classrooms and many test items share a common grouping structure, such as a content strand or a reading passage. Consequently, one possible approach is to explicitly recognize the clustered nature of the data and directly incorporate random effects to account for the various dependencies.  This article demonstrates how the multilevel Rasch model can be estimated using the functions in R for mixed-effects models with crossed or partially crossed random effects. We demonstrate how to model the following hierarchical data structures: a) individuals clustered in similar settings (e.g., classrooms, schools), b) items nested within a particular group (such as a content strand or a reading passage), and c) how to estimate a teacher x content strand interaction.},

One can describe the difference between constructs and concepts in terms of set theory. Constructs extend over actual cases, whereas concepts extend over both actual and possible cases. As such, theoretical claims made about, say, integrity as a construct differ from claims about integrity as a concept. The restriction of constructs to a specified population plays a central role in test validation and psychometric analyses aimed at distinguishing constructs from one another. The extension of concepts over possible populations plays a central role in the adoption of nonactual possibilities as goals in making efforts toward systemic change and also in the comparison of constructs across populations. The failure of the standard idiom, which conflates constructs with concepts, to provide a vocabulary that captures both population-dependent and population-independent aspects of variables recommends the modification of that idiom to distinguish constructs from concepts.

In proposing quantitative theories and claiming to measure the attributes involved, psychologists are logically committed to both tasks. However, they have adopted their own, special, definition of measurement, one that deflects attention away from the scientific task. It is argued that this is not accidental. From Fechner onwards, the dominant tradition in quantitative psychology ignored this task. Stevens' definition rationalized this neglect. The widespread acceptance of this definition within psychology made this neglect systemic, with the consequence that the implications of contemporary research in measurement theory for undertaking the scientific task are not appreciated. It is argued further that when the ideological support structures of a science sustain serious blind spots like this, then that science is in the grip of some kind of thought disorder. …unluckily our professors of psychology in general are not up to quantitative logic… E.

	abstract = {Rasch's unidimensional models for measurement show how to connect object measures (e.g., reader abilities), measurement mechanisms (e.g., machine-generated cloze reading items), and observational outcomes (e.g., counts correct on reading instruments). Substantive theory shows what interventions or manipulations to the measurement mechanism can be traded off against a change to the object measure to hold the observed outcome constant. A Rasch model integrated with a substantive theory dictates the form and substance of permissible interventions. Rasch analysis, absent construct theory and an associated specification equation, is a black box in which understanding may be more illusory than not. Finally, the quantitative hypothesis can be tested by comparing theory-based trade-off relations with observed trade-off relations. Only quantitative variables (as measured) support such trade-offs. Note that to test the quantitative hypothesis requires more than manipulation of the algebraic equivalencies in the Rasch model or descriptively fitting data to the model. A causal Rasch model involves experimental intervention/manipulation on either reader ability or text complexity or a conjoint intervention on both simultaneously to yield a successful prediction of the resultant observed outcome (count correct). We conjecture that when this type of manipulation is introduced for individual reader text encounters and model predictions are consistent with observations, the quantitative hypothesis is sustained.},

These mainstays of psychometrics ensured that theoretical constructs were more frequently dispositional concepts than they were mental concepts. It is with the latter, however, especially with attempts to measure currently occurring mental states, such as anxiety, that Franz?s argument looks more promising, but nevertheless it fails because it rests upon Wittgenstein?s views about the grammar of mental discourse. I conclude that conceptual analysis, realistically construed and applied to mental concepts, may show that they exclude quantitative structure. Despite that, it is always possible that empirical research might elicit quantitative-friendly revisions of mental concepts.},

As illuminated by Wittgenstein almost a century ago, the concepts of psychology are everyday concepts rather than technical ones.

This premise is false for counted quantities, amount of substance, electric charge, and others that are constrained to exist in integral multiples of a quantum. A software application that treats these quantities as continuous can predict outcomes that are physically impossible, such as the production of half a photon. Thus far, formalizations of quantity calculus have not addressed how quantities that are structured like the integers should interoperate with continuous quantities. This article introduces the extension of quantity calculus to include quantal quantities, which vary in steps rather than continuously, and discusses the consequences of including them.
Savage's foundation of expected utility is considered to be the most convincing justification of Bayesian expected utility and the crowning glory of decision theory. It combines exceptionally appealing axioms with deep mathematics. Despite the wide influence and deep respect that Savage received in economics and statistics, virtually no one touched his mathematical tools. We provide an updated analysis that is more general and more accessible. Our derivations are self-contained. This helps to better appreciate the depth and beauty of Savage's work and the foundations of Bayesianism, to teach it more easily, and to develop non-Bayesian generalizations incorporating ambiguity more efficiently.
This paper studies a balance whose unobservable fulcrum is not necessarily located at the middle of its two pans. It presents three different models, showing how this lack of symmetry modifies the observation, the formalism and the interpretation of such a biased measuring device. It argues that the biased balance can be an interesting source of inspiration for our abstract understanding of how a measuring device influences the measurement process.
Although measurement has been an important component of human activities for millennia, it remains remarkably difficult to provide a fully satisfactory definition of the concept. In part this is due to the fact that measurement is a diverse and dynamic human activity, and takes shape in a wide variety of ways depending on the nature of the subject matter, application, and context. If a definition of measurement is to pay respect to this basic fact, it cannot be so narrowly construed as to apply to only one area of scientific activity (e.g., physics); on the other hand, the definition cannot be so permissive as to trivialize the concept to the point that measurement is not recognizably superior to, for instance, guesses or statements of opinion. One issue at the heart of this tension is the relationship between the concepts of measurement, quantity, and quantification. In particular, it is sometimes argued or assumed either that quantification is a necessary condition for measurement, or that quantification is simply synonymous with measurement. To assess the validity of these positions, the concepts of measurement, quantity, and quantification should be independently defined and their relationships analyzed. In this paper we conduct such an analysis, from both historical and philosophical perspectives, and present the case that quantification is neither necessary nor sufficient for measurement. We conclude by considering how the conceptual separation of measurement and quantification serves to promote more productive and shared understandings of measurement across disciplines.
It has been known since the work of Duskin and Pelletier four decades ago that Kop{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}msup is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="sans-serif" is="true"{\textgreater}K{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal" is="true"{\textgreater}op{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msup{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}, the opposite of the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps, is monadic over the category of sets.

Isbell showed in 1982 that the Lawvere–Linton algebraic theory of Δ can be generated using a finite number of finitary operations, together with a single operation of countably infinite arity. In 1983, Banaschewski and Rosický independently proved a conjecture of Bankston, establishing a strong negative result on the axiomatisability of Kop{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}msup is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="sans-serif" is="true"{\textgreater}K{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal" is="true"{\textgreater}op{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msup{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}. In particular, Δ is not a finitary variety – Isbell's result is best possible. The problem of axiomatising Δ by equations has remained open. Using the theory of Chang's MV-algebras as a key tool, along with Isbell's fundamental insight on the semantic nature of the infinitary operation, we provide a finite axiomatisation of Δ.
This is a paper on the foundations of individual rational choice, specifically on the foundations of consumer theory. Neoclassical consumer theory requires that the behavior of the consumer be explained by means of a preference relation, and that all the required properties of the corresponding utility representation be derived from the properties of this relation. Yet, it is not clear what is the meaning of the property of the preference relation required in order to show that it is representable by means of a continuously differentiable C1 utility function. The aim of the present paper is to propose an explanation of such property and to prove the existence of a C1 representation.
Este es un artículo sobre los fundamentos de la teoría de la elección racional individual, específicamente sobre los fundamentos de la teoría del consumidor. La teoría neoclásica del consumidor requiere que el comportamiento del consumidor sea explicado mediante una relación de preferencia y que todas las propiedades requeridas de la correspondiente función de utilidad que la represente sean derivadas de las propiedades de esta relación. No obstante, no está claro cuál es el significado de la propiedad de la relación de preferencia requerida para mostrar que la misma es representable mediante una función continuamente diferenciable (C1). El propósito del presente artículo es proponer una explicación de tal propiedad y demostrar la existencia de una representación.
In Thas (2014) it was explained how one can naturally associate a Deitmar scheme (which is a scheme defined over the field with one element, F1{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}msub is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{\textgreater}F{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mn is="true"{\textgreater}1{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}) to a so-called “loose graph” (which is a generalization of a graph).

In this paper, we first modify the construction of loc. cit., and show that Deitmar schemes which are defined by finite trees (with possible end points) are “defined over F1{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}msub is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{\textgreater}F{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mn is="true"{\textgreater}1{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}” in Kurokawa’s sense; we then derive a precise formula for the Kurokawa zeta function for such schemes (and so also for the counting polynomial of all associated Fq{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}msub is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{\textgreater}F{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi is="true"{\textgreater}q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}-schemes). As a corollary, we find a zeta function for all such trees which contains information such as the number of inner points and the spectrum of degrees, and which is thus very different than Ihara’s zeta function (which is trivial in this case). Using a process called “surgery,” we show that one can determine the zeta function of a general loose graph and its associated \{Deitmar, Grothendieck\}-schemes in a number of steps, eventually reducing the calculation essentially to trees. We study a number of classes of examples of loose graphs, and introduce the Grothendieck ring of F1{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}msub is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{\textgreater}F{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow is="true"{\textgreater}{\textless}mn is="true"{\textgreater}1{\textless}/mn{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/msub{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}-schemes along the way in order to perform the calculations. Finally, we include a computer program for performing more tedious calculations, and compare the new zeta function to Ihara’s zeta function for graphs in a number of examples.
In both scientific and lay settings, measurement is considered a privileged source of high-quality information, and is commonly associated with precision, accuracy, and dependability. However, it is not always clear what features of the measurement process justify this public trust, and how the quality of measurement results in different domains of inquiry can be compared. In this paper, we first argue that the quality of measurement results depends on their object-relatedness (“objectivity”) and subject-independence (“intersubjectivity”) and is justified on the basis of the structural features of the measurement process, as well as features of the inputs or the outputs of the process. Given this perspective, we analyze three general measurement methods, according to which a measurement process can be structured and performed, which may be called (a) direct synchronous, (b) direct asynchronous, and (c) indirect. In addition to the value of these distinctions for the process of designing measuring instruments, they allow us to highlight the different roles of models, theories, and computations in measurement. We then attempt to apply this classification strategy in the context of the social sciences by discussing the role of (1) the definition of the measurand and (2) the theory connecting the measurand to the measurement results in each of these measurement methods, and how they can or cannot be conceptualized from the perspective of measurement theories in the social sciences. This leads us to the conclusion that the differences between physical and non-physical measurement are historical and contextual rather than essential; that is, in both cases, the quality of measurement results can be effectively evaluated from a structural perspective.
I argue that instead of a rather narrow focus on N. Bohr's account of complementarity as a particular and perhaps obscure metaphysical or epistemological concept (or as being motivated by such a concept), we should consider it to result from pursuing a particular method of studying physical phenomena. More precisely, I identify a strong undercurrent of Baconian method of induction in Bohr's work that likely emerged during his experimental training and practice. When its development is analyzed in light of Baconian induction, complementarity emerges as a levelheaded rather than a controversial account, carefully elicited from a comprehensive grasp of the available experimental basis, shunning hasty metaphysically motivated generalizations based on partial experimental evidence. In fact, Bohr's insistence on the “classical” nature of observations in experiments, as well as the counterintuitive synthesis of wave and particle concepts that have puzzled scholars, seem a natural outcome (an updated instance) of the inductive method. Such analysis clarifies the intricacies of early Schrödinger's critique of the account as well as Bohr's response, which have been misinterpreted in the literature. If adequate, the analysis may lend considerable support to the view that Bacon explicated the general terms of an experimentally minded strand of the scientific method, developed and refined by scientists in the following three centuries.
In the last few decades foundations of measurement have developed so as to account for both the role of modeling in measurement, in particular relating to the presence and the effects of measurement uncertainty, and the fact that any measurement is performed by using instruments that work on the basis of transduction effects and provide justified results only in so far as they are properly calibrated. This has triggered a new interest about the role of instruments in the models of measurement. The structure of the process has been variously studied in reference to the connection between measured properties and indications provided by instruments, and to the way in which intersubjective information on the measurand is acquired through instrument calibration. From such a background this paper proposes a comprehensive structural model of direct measurement, whose functional elements, empirical and informational, are presented with a bottom-up strategy as a set of interrelated modules. The result, shown to be a generalization of some of the models currently available in the literature of measurement science, highlights the key role of scales for measurement, clarifies the conceptual and operative relations between direct measurement and calibration, and identifies the principal sources of measurement uncertainty in the structural context of the process. This model is intended to interpret both physical and non-physical measurements, and as such it is a component of a “measurement across the sciences” research programme.
Generalized counting constraint satisfaction problems include Holant problems with planarity restrictions; polynomial-time algorithms for such problems include matchgates and matchcircuits, which are based on Pfaffians. In particular, they use gates which are expressible in terms of a vector of sub-Pfaffians of a skew-symmetric matrix. We introduce a new type of circuit based instead on determinants, with seemingly different expressive power. In these determinantal circuits, a gate is represented by the vector of all minors of an arbitrary matrix. Determinantal circuits permit a different class of gates. Applications of these circuits include proofs of theorems from algebraic graph theory including the Chung–Langlands formula for the number of rooted spanning forests of a graph and computing Tutte polynomials of certain matroids. They also give a strategy for simulating quantum circuits with closed timelike curves. Monoidal category theory provides a useful language for discussing such counting problems, turning combinatorial restrictions into categorical properties. We introduce the counting problem in monoidal categories and count-preserving functors as a way to study FP{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="sans-serif" is="true"{\textgreater}FP{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} subclasses of problems in settings which are generally \#P{\textless}math{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal" is="true"{\textgreater}\#{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="sans-serif" is="true"{\textgreater}P{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}-hard. Using this machinery we show that, surprisingly, determinantal circuits can be simulated by Pfaffian circuits at quadratic cost.
We suggest a normative model for the evaluation of explanations B because A based on probabilistic conditional reasoning and compare it with empirical data. According to the modus ponens model of explanations, the probability of B because A should equal the joint probability of the conditional if A then B and the explanans A. We argue that B because A expresses the conjunction of A and B as well as positive relevance of A for B. In Study 1, participants (N = 80) judged the subjective probabilities of 20 sets of statements with a focus on belief-based reasoning under uncertainty. In Study 2, participants (N = 376) were assigned to one of six item sets for which we varied the inferential relevance of A for B to explore boundary conditions of our model. We assessed the performance of our model across a range of analyses and report results on the Equation, a fundamental model in research on probabilistic reasoning concerning the evaluation of conditionals. In both studies, results indicate that participants' belief in statements B because A followed model predictions systematically. However, a sizeable proportion of sets of beliefs contained at least one incoherence, indicating deviations from the norms of rationality suggested by our model. In addition, results of Study 2 lend support to the idea that inferential relevance may be relevant for the evaluation of both conditionals and explanations.},

	abstract = {The essential character of what is classically considered, e.g., by N. R. Campbell, the fundamental measurement of extensive quantities is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) arbitrary combinations of “quantities” of a single specified kind. For example, the effect of placing one arbitrary combination of masses on a pan of a beam balance is compared with another arbitrary combination on the other pan. Measurement on a ratio scale follows from such axioms. In this paper, the essential character of simultaneous conjoint measurement is described by an axiomatization for the comparision of effects of (or responses to) pairs formed from two specified kinds of “quantities”. The axioms apply when, for example, the effect of a pair consisting of one mass and one difference in gravitational potential on a device that responds to momentum is compared with the effect of another such pair. Measurement on interval scales which have a common unit follows from these axioms; usually these scales can be converted in a natural way into ratio scales. A close relation exists between conjoint measurement and the establishment of response measures in a two-way table, or other analysis-of-variance situations, for which the “effects of columns” and the “effects of rows” are additive. Indeed, the discovery of such measures, which are well known to have important practical advantages, may be viewed as the discovery, via conjoint measurement, of fundamental measures of the row and column variables. From this point of view it is natural to regard conjoint measurement as factorial measurement.},

	abstract = {The paper addresses three neglected questions from IRT. In section 1, the properties of the “measurement” of ability or trait parameters and item difficulty parameters in the Rasch model are discussed. It is shown that the solution to this problem is rather complex and depends both on general assumptions about properties of the item response functions and on assumptions about the available item universe. Section 2 deals with the measurement of individual change or “modifiability” based on a Rasch test. A conditional likelihood approach is presented that yields (a) an ML estimator of modifiability for given item parameters, (b) allows one to test hypotheses about change by means of a Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for the modifiability parameter, or (c) to estimate modifiability jointly with the item parameters. Uniqueness results for all three methods are also presented. In section 3, the Mantel-Haenszel method for detecting DIF is discussed under a novel perspective: What is the most general framework within which the Mantel-Haenszel method correctly detects DIF of a studied item? The answer is that this is a 2PL model where, however, all discrimination parameters are known and the studied item has the same discrimination in both populations. Since these requirements would hardly be satisfied in practical applications, the case of constant discrimination parameters, that is, the Rasch model, is the only realistic framework. A simple Pearsonx2 test for DIF of one studied item is proposed as an alternative to the Mantel-Haenszel test; moreover, this test is generalized to the case of two items simultaneously studied for DIF.},

	abstract = {This dissertation consists of three papers on a central topic: the application of scale type theory to the Rasch and 2PL models. Each paper uses a different framework or set of frameworks for defining a typology of scales.In the first paper, I begin the analysis of scale types through the Stevens (1946) typology. I introduce the notion of difference scales using a formalization of this typology. In applying this formalization to the Rasch and 2PL models, I discuss alternate paradigms for conceptualizing the restrictive assumptions of the Rasch model.In the second paper, I apply the Suppes (1958) typology to the two IRT models. The conclusions here echo and reinforce those of the first chapter. In the second half of this paper, I examine other perspectives on connecting scale type theory and the Rasch model, focusing on the case of additive conjoint measurement theory.The first two papers consider the scale types of the odds and logit forms of the models separately. In the third paper, I look at typologies in which the model form is not a factor. The first of these is the axiomatic system of Hölder (1901), which identifies two types of quantities: magnitudes, and points on a line. The second is the homogeneity-uniqueness typology of Narens and Luce (1986), which classifies scales by the types of choices that are possible during the process of numeral assignment.Together, the three papers form an argument for considering psychometric properties behaving as predicted by the Rasch model as having the scale type of ratio scale attributes, while those that behave as predicted by the 2PL model have the scale type of interval scale attributes.},

Lord (1953) challenged this theory. In a thought experiment, a t-test is performed on football numbers (identifying players: a nominal representation) to decide whether a sample from the machine issuing these numbers should be considered non-random. This is an inadmissible test, since its outcomes are not invariant under admissible transformations for the nominal measurement level. Nevertheless, it results in a sensible conclusion: the number-issuing machine was tampered with. The present aim is to show that the thought experiment contains a serious ﬂaw. First, the assumption that the numbers are nominal is shown to be false. Second, it is argued that the football numbers represent the amount of bias in the machine. The level of bias in the machine, indicated by the population mean, conforms to a bisymmetric structure, which means that it lies on an interval scale. In this light, Lord’s thought experiment interpreted by many as a problematic counterexample to Stevens’ theory of admissible statistics conforms perfectly to Stevens’ dictum.},

But, if the relevant attributes are already presumed to be quantitative, the perceived differences are minimized and the Rasch model might seem to be a version of conjoint measurement. It is on this basis that Rasch modellers pursue their paradoxical quest for measurement. However, because the relevant attributes are not actually known to be quantitative, use of the Rasch model to measure psychological attributes remains logically dependent upon the outcome of research involving the theory of conjoint measurement or something very similar.},

Most of the founders of the discipline committed it and it makes sense of otherwise anomalous developments within the discipline, such as the permissible statistics controversy and the dominant form taken by item response theories. The fallacy is displayed by showing (1) that an attribute's quantitative structure reduces to a weak order upon differences between degrees that satisfies the double cancellation, solvability, and Archimedean conditions of conjoint measurement theory and (2) the fact that any order on the degrees themselves does not entail sufficient structure on this weak order to guarantee satisfaction of these conditions. Thus, it is possible that an ordered attribute is non-quantitative. Also, each pair of differences between degrees of an ordinal attribute falls into one of two disjoint classes: (1) those where the order relation between the pair follows from an order on the attribute and (2) those where it is independent of that order and possibly diagnostic of quantitative structure and this fact means that the distinction between order and quantity is an empirical one.},

Survey, assessment, and test scores in educational and psychological measurement are often interpreted in ways that assume a concatenation of units to have been established, even though these assumptions are rarely stated or tested. A concatenation model for measurement is shown to be equivalent to a Rasch model: any two units of measurement placed end to end must together be of the same length as either one of them added to itself. This additive principle and a concatenation model of measurement together serve as a heuristic guide for organizing two experimental approaches to calibrating instruments for measuring length. The capacity to reproduce the unit of measurement from theory with no need for repeated empirical calibration experiments, as in the geometrical bisection of the line and the resultant halving of the length measure, is highlighted as essential to demonstrating a thorough understanding of the construct.},

	abstract = {This article aims to improve theory formation in psychology by developing a practical methodology for constructing explanatory theories: theory construction methodology (TCM). TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

I argue that through the metaphors ‘more is up’ and ‘good is up’ we spatialise concepts that are not intrinsically spatial. Human abilities form a distinct conceptual category, with complex and varying rules for the correct usage of different ability terms. The fact that most abilities can be discussed in terms of both ‘possession’ and of ‘more or less’ invites reification, spatialisation, and hence the application of measurement metaphors. Insights into the measurement of abilities can be gained by careful consideration of how ability terms are used in normal discourse, especially of athletic abilities which are partly quantified in terms of attributes that are physically measureable. The fuzziness of natural language creates some of the problems in understanding standards in both psychometrics and physical measurement.},

	abstract = {Recently, quantitative measurement in Item Response Theory was questioned because it seems based on a paradox concerning error and precision (Michell, 2008a). The Rasch model ensures interval level measurement. If precision increases in Rasch items, they become Guttman items, losing their quantitative properties. Removing error decreases precision. To address this paradox we consider to what extent both models meet the requirements for interval level measurement. This leads us to conclude that the Guttman model cannot simply be considered an error-free version of the Rasch model. Furthermore, we argue that an increase in precision by adding error is not paradoxical per se, by discussing the well-known phenomenon of stochastic resonance. These arguments together lead us to conclude that the paradox disappears when the crucial aspects of continuity and measurement level, and not error and precision, are considered. 48 4. The Guttman-Rasch Paradox in Item Response Theory 4.1 Measurement Level Difference in IRT Models There is an unusual difference in measurement level between the closely related Guttman and Rasch models in Item Response Theory (IRT). The Rasch model, a stochastic model that incorporates error, is said to yield measurement at the interval level (e.g., Wright, 1999; Bond \& Fox, 2007). A deterministic, error-free version of this model is the Guttman model (Guttman, 1950). Although this model is devoid of error, it provides measurement at the ordinal level only. It has been pointed out by various scholars that this presents us with a paradox (Duncan, 1984; Fischer, 1995; Kyngdon, 2008b). The problem is stated most eloquently by Michell, who asks: Is it not paradoxical that improving the precision of our observational conditions decreases the precision of our observations? (Michell, 2008a, p. 15, l. 5-7). In other words, one would hardly expect that removing measurement error from our procedures and instruments would hurt, rather than help measurement precision. Previous comments on this paradoxical loss of measurement level were never much more than cursory notes, until Michell (2008a, 2009) recently reintroduced the paradox to argue against the claim that the Rasch model yields interval level measurement. His objection is nicely illustrated by the following analogy. Suppose astronomers discover a new star. They think a planetary system around this star can be observed, although an obscuring haze impedes observation. Now suppose this haze suddenly disappears and observation is entirely unobstructed. If, along with the haze, the planetary system were no longer detectable, what would the astronomers conclude? Obviously the existence of the system would be considered highly doubtful, because the observation depends solely on the presence of error. By analogy, the claim that the Rasch model yields interval level measurement should be doubted, because it too disappears when our view is no longer obstructed by error (Michell, 2008a, p. 15, l. 8-19, paraphrased). This argument clearly demonstrates a deep concern regarding the merit of measurement claims in psychometrics and psychology in general. We share this concern. The assertion of interval level measurement is anything but trivial. It involves assumptions and restrictions that far too often remain implicit and untested. Objections to such claims, when based on lack of empirical verification or blind acceptance of shaky assumptions, need to be addressed. In this context the Guttman-Rasch paradox clearly demands 4.1. Measurement Level Difference in IRT Models 49 our attention. It is important with respect to the status of commonly used measurement models, and by extension to the status of applications of psychological measurement in society at large. We therefore hope to answer two questions that naturally follow from the renewed interest in the Guttman-Rasch paradox. First, does the paradox indeed have merit as an argument against the claim of interval level measurement by the Rasch model? Second, is the change in measurement level truly paradoxical? Both questions will be answered with a resounding ‘no’. To be clear, the goal is not to argue in support of the claim of interval level measurement by the Rasch model. Instead, we show that the paradox is irrelevant to the discussion. The recent characterization of the Guttman-Rasch paradox does not contribute constructively to the debate on the status of measurement pretensions associated with psychological models and measurement procedures. The paradox, as presented above, paints a grossly oversimplified picture of the relation between the Guttman and Rasch models and the relation between measurement level and measurement precision in general. We consider how the argument that employs the paradox is structured and show why this argument is flawed. From this we will see that the paradox itself is an illusion, fostered primarily by ill-chosen formulation. The difference in measurement level between the Guttman and Rasch models is in fact entirely non-paradoxical (see also Sijtsma, 2011 for another approach leading to the same conclusion). The argument, as we believe it to be generally understood, consists of the following propositions: 1. The Guttman model yields ordinal measurement; 2. The Rasch model yields interval measurement; 3. The only difference between the models is error, and: 4. Removal of error cannot decrease measurement precision. This last proposition is false when we apply it to the Guttman-Rasch paradox; precision does decrease when we remove error from the Rasch model and are left with the ordinal Guttman model. Therefore scholars like Michell conclude that the second proposition (i.e. the Rasch model yields interval measurement) is false. To show where this argument fails and to better 50 4. The Guttman-Rasch Paradox in Item Response Theory understand the paradox itself, the validity of each of these propositions will be discussed. Before we can turn to the first two propositions that assert the measurement pretensions of the Guttman and Rasch model however, we need to introduce these two models in more detail. 4.2 Guttman and Rasch The Guttman and Rasch models are closely related Item Response Theory (IRT) models. IRT is commonly accepted as an improvement over Classical Test Theory (CTT). With IRT we can, for instance, equate tests, investigate item bias, and develop computer adaptive tests. Conceptually, IRT models differ from CTT in two major respects. First, they assume that participant responses to each item of a test can be related to an underlying trait or latent variable. This variable could be a preference, attitude, ability or personality trait, such as paranoia. Both items and participants are assumed to be comparable on the same underlying, one-dimensional continuum reflecting this variable. When a participant ‘dominates’ an item, we would expect the participant to answer the item correctly or to endorse it. For example, a very paranoid person is expected to endorse the item “I often think people talk about me behind my back”. Second, IRT models explicitly specify the relation between the latent variable and the chance of endorsing an item. Different IRT models assume different relational forms. Models can be deterministic or stochastic, discrete or continuous, linear or non-linear. Table 4.1: Typical probability patterns for the Guttman and Rasch model (a) Guttman model probabilities},

	abstract = {Although multitasking has been the subject of a large number of papers and experiments, the term task is still not well defined. In this opinion paper, we adopt the ideomotor perspective to define the term task and distinguish it from the terms goal and action. In our opinion, actions are movements executed by an actor to achieve a concrete goal. Concrete goals are represented as anticipated sensory consequences that are associated with an action in an ideomotor manner. Concrete goals are nested in a hierarchy of more and more abstract goals, which form the context of the corresponding action. Finally, tasks are depersonalized goals, i.e., goals that should be achieved by someone. However, tasks can be assigned to a specific person or group of persons, either by a third party or by the person or the group of persons themselves. By accepting this assignment, the depersonalized task becomes a personal goal. In our opinion, research on multitasking needs to confine its scope to the analysis of concrete tasks, which result in concrete goals as anticipated sensory consequences of the corresponding action. We further argue that the distinction between dual- and single-tasking is dependent on the subjective conception of the task assignment, the goal representation and previous experience. Finally, we conclude that it is not the tasks, but the performing of the tasks, i.e. the actions that cause costs in multitasking experiments.},

The history of scientific measurement, from antiquity to the present may be interpreted as revealing a progressive deepening in the understanding of this position. First, the concept of ratio was broadened to include ratios between incommensurable magnitudes; second, the concept of a quantitative attribute was broadened to include non-extensive quantities; third, quantitative structure and its relations to ratios and real numbers were elaborated; and finally, the issue of empirically distinguishing between quantitative and non-quantitative structures was addressed.

In our view, whether this is possible depends on what one is prepared to accept as an empirical relational system.

While several R packages have been developed that implement IRT models, they tend to be restricted to respective prespecified classes of models.

We demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and fit a wide range of Bayesian IRT models using flexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even define their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common IRT model classes that can be specified natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diffusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and post-processed.

The resulting metrics are sensitive to both within-individual factors, including objective load and reward amount, and between-individual factors, including age and trait cognitive engagement. We further validate cognitive effort discounting by benchmarking it against well-established measures of delay discounting.

	abstract = {Stimulants such as methylphenidate are increasingly used for cognitive enhancement but precise mechanisms are unknown. We found that methylphenidate boosts willingness to expend cognitive effort by altering the benefit-to-cost ratio of cognitive work. Willingness to expend effort was greater for participants with higher striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, whereas methylphenidate and sulpiride, a selective D2 receptor antagonist, increased cognitive motivation more for participants with lower synthesis capacity. A sequential sampling model informed by momentary gaze revealed that decisions to expend effort are related to amplification of benefit-versus-cost information attended early in the decision process, whereas the effect of benefits is strengthened with higher synthesis capacity and by methylphenidate. These findings demonstrate that methylphenidate boosts the perceived benefits versus costs of cognitive effort by modulating striatal dopamine signaling.},

	abstract = {Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is critical for acquiring visual knowledge and shows marked individual variability. Previous work has illustrated a VSTM advantage among action video game players (Boot et al. Acta Psychologica 129:387–398, 2008). A growing body of literature has suggested that action video game playing can bolster visual cognitive abilities in a domain-general manner, including abilities related to visual attention and the speed of processing, providing some potential bases for this VSTM advantage. In the present study, we investigated the VSTM advantage among video game players and assessed whether enhanced processing speed can account for this advantage. Experiment 1, using simple colored stimuli, revealed that action video game players demonstrate a similar VSTM advantage over nongamers, regardless of whether they are given limited or ample time to encode items into memory. Experiment 2, using complex shapes as the stimuli to increase the processing demands of the task, replicated this VSTM advantage, irrespective of encoding duration. These findings are inconsistent with a speed-of-processing account of this advantage. An alternative, attentional account, grounded in the existing literature on the visuo-cognitive consequences of video game play, is discussed.},

A wristband photoplethysmogram (PPG) was provided as a representative of wearable devices. In addition, a clinical device that can record Electrocardiography (ECG) , galvanic skin response (GSR) and, fingertip PPG was included in the database as a reference. The MW was induced by performing the N-back task with 22 subjects. The participants were asked to answer the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire at the beginning of the experiment and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire after each N-back task. The result of data analysis show the potential uses of the recorded modalities and the feasibility of the MW elicitation protocol. Finally the MAUS dataset is now available for academic use (The MAUS dataset is available at IEEE Dataport: https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/maus-dataset-mental-workload-assessment-n-back-task-using-wearable-sensor). Besides, we also presents a reproducible baseline system as a preliminary benchmark (The code of the baseline system on MAUS dataset is available on Github: https://github.com/rickwu11/MAUS{\textbackslash}\_dataset{\textbackslash}\_baseline{\textbackslash}\_system), which testing accuracy are 71.6 \%, 66.7 \%, and 59.9 \% in ECG, fingertip PPG, wristband PPG, respectively.},

One approach to quantify the SVs of levels of a cognitive task is the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm by Westbrook and colleagues (2013). However, it fails to acknowledge the highly subjective nature of effort, as it assumes a unidirectional, inverse relationship between task load and SVs. Therefore, it cannot map differences in effort perception that arise from traits like Need for Cognition, since individuals who enjoy effortful cognitive activities likely do not prefer the easiest level. We aim to replicate the analysis of Westbrook and colleagues with our adaptation, the Cognitive and Affective Discounting (CAD) Paradigm, which quantifies SVs without assuming that the easiest level is preferred, thereby enabling the quantification of SVs for tasks without objective order of task load.},

When responses were missing not at random (MNAR), item parameters were severely biased, especially when the proportion of missing responses was high. Standard errors were primarily affected by sample size, with larger samples associated with smaller standard errors. Standard errors were inflated in MCAR and MAR conditions, while MNAR standard errors were similar to what they would have been, had the data been complete.

The exact specifications Rasch outlined for making comparisons are explicated from quotes, and the role of causality derived from making comparisons is also examined. Understanding causality has implications for what can and cannot be produced via Rasch measurement. His simple examples were instructive, but the implications are far reaching upon first establishing the key role of comparison.},

Psychologists think that theorising in the area of psychological testing involves conjuring constructs, which are operationally defined and measured via psychometric tests. However, the ‘construct’ concept is unworkable and laden with confused philosophical baggage accrued under the hegemony of logical empiricism, and its real function in psychology is obscured. Via an analysis of its history and logic, I expose its flawed conception of the relation between theoretical and observable concepts and the way in which it serves the myth of mental measurement. Finally, it is shown how the actual logic of theorising in science, which entails that theories are best inferred from relevant phenomena, not imaginatively constructed, oppugns this myth and promises to coordinate theoretical concepts with the phenomena to be explained.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/46vn5},
	abstract = {The actual capacity to perform tasks, and actual fatigue, are concepts that have been thought of as inherently linked. These considerations also extend to their phenomenology, meaning the *perception(s) of* capacity or fatigue. The phenomenology of capacity or fatigue thus may be capturing the same underlying latent construct. Further, it is speculated that the actual capacity of a person to perform a given task, and their perception of that capacity, have a psychophysical relationship. The aim of this study was therefore twofold: 1) to explore the extensional equivalence of perceptions of capacity and fatigue, and 2) to explore the relationship between actual capacity and the perception of that capacity. We analysed secondary outcomes from two experiments where 21 participants performed various elbow flexion tasks with either a dumbell, or a connected adaptive resistance exercise (CARE) machine enabling measurement of actual capacity (i.e., maximal force). Mixed effects ordered beta regression models estimated the latent constructs during conditions from self-reports of perceptions of capacity and fatigue comparing the two operationalisations, and the relationship between actual capacity (i.e., \% maximal force) and self-reports of perceptions of capacity. We hypothesised that, given their theoretical extensional equivalence, the latent constructs captured by self-report ratings as operationalisations of perceptions of capacity and fatigue would exhibit a strong negative relationship between each other reflecting strong identity, and a positive association albeit with weak as opposed to strong identity between actual capacity and perception of capacity. Our results appear to broadly corroborate both hypotheses. There was a very strong relationship indicating strong identity and thus extensional equivalence of perceptions of capacity and fatigue latent constructs (r = -0.989 [95\% CI -0.994 to -0.981]). Further, a coarse grained directional relationship between actual capacity and the perception of capacity was present suggesting only weak identity at best. Future research should endeavour to identify conditions permitting testing of assumptions of the present work (i.e., the quantity assumption) and explore further possible psychophysical models relating actual, and perceptions of, demands, capacity, and effort to understand the impact of the former upon the latter given the conceptual relationships between them.},

The model can be estimated with or without observations at the bounds, and as such is a general solution for these types of data. Employing a Monte Carlo simulation, I show that the model is noticeably more efficient than ordinary least squares regression, zero-and-one-inflated Beta regression, rescaled Beta regression, and fractional logit while fully capturing nuances in the outcome. I apply the model to a replication of the Aidt and Jensen (2014, European Economic Review 72, 52–75) study of suffrage extensions in Europe. The model can be fit with the R package ordbetareg to facilitate hierarchical, dynamic, and multivariate modeling.},
