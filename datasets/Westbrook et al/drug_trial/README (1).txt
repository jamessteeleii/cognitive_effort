# Abstract

This collection is not linked to one specific publication, but contains raw data collected during the course of one project consisting of several subprojects, which will result in multiple outputs/publications. The raw data is shared here, while each subproject will be described and shared in their individual sharing collections upon publication. 

Design: Within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. 100 healthy Dutch native speakers were recruited. Aim: We aim to develop a proxy-model of baseline dopamine based on machine learning methods which would provide us with behavioural predictors of the effects of dopaminergic drugs on brain and cognition that maximally generalize to new participants. Intervention: Subjects attended five study days; one screening session, three pharmaco-fMRI session (MPH, SUL and PLO) and one session for PET acquisition (carbidopa, entacapone and [18F]DOPA). Subjects completed a baseline battery measure, questionnaires, a structural MRI scan, and completed a battery of computerized tests in and outside of the fMRI scanner. Subjects received oral capsules of 20mg methylphenidate (MPH), 400mg sulpiride (SUL) and placebo (PLO) according to a double-dummy design; participants received two capsules on two separate time points per pharmaco-fMRI session. Participants received PLO or MPH 90 min after receiving PLO or SUL. For PET acquisition subjects received oral capsules of 150mg carbidopa and 400mg entacapone (about 50 min before injection), and a 185 MBq (5 mCi) [18F]-fluoro-dopa ([18F]DOPA) intravenous injection.
